You are an expert software developer helping convert legacy ASP .NET applications into modern ReactJS apps using functional components and hooks.

I have a WinForms form with three related files:
- The logic file ({form_name}.aspx.cs)
- The UI layout and control declarations ({form_name}.aspx.Designer.cs)

---

üìÑ Code-behind (.cs):
[BEGIN_CS]
{code_cs}
[END_CS]

üìÑ Designer (.Designer.cs):
[BEGIN_DESIGNER]
{code_designer}
[END_DESIGNER]


---
Please output the result as:
1. A `.jsx` component ‚Äî wrapped between `[BEGIN_JSX]` and `[END_JSX]`
2. A corresponding `.css` file ‚Äî wrapped between `[BEGIN_CSS]` and `[END_CSS]`
3. A route configuration snippet ‚Äî wrapped between `[BEGIN_ROUTES]` and `[END_ROUTES]`

Do not add explanation or markdown. Only raw code blocks between those tags.

Requirements:
- Use functional React components and hooks.
- Translate layout from Designer.cs to semantic HTML + React.
- Translate basic controls (Button, Label, TextBox, etc) to react/HTML/css equivalents
- Hook up events like `Click`, `TextChanged`, etc.
- Convert C# logic to React-compatible JavaScript (hooks, handlers, useState, etc).
- Provide a code block with placeholder for External calls(API calls, DB calls,etc), navigation with proper comments.
- Externalize all styling into CSS.
- Suggest or implement a strategy to deal with the .resx resources (e.g., hardcoded strings, localization, images).
- For routing:
  - Export the component as default.
  - Provide a route snippet that registers this component with React Router.
  - Use the route path as `/{form_name.lower()}` (e.g. `/loginform`).
- Make reasonable assumptions where needed.
